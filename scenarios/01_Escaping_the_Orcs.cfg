It is the story of Meneldur the Mariner, who used the newfound knowledge to resurrect some of the old. But, it is, most of all, the story of the voyage of his ship, and what he encountered while traveling the high seas..."

Instead, they remained near land, and sailed only north and south, for they dimly remembered tales from Haldric's day, of dragons, and sea serpents, and snake-men, who lurked on the islands that lay to the west of the continent."
