# Saving_Elensefar
A Wesnoth add-on campaign, copied from the 1.12 add-on server to forward-port to 1.14.

Note that MoonyDragon beat me to getting his version uploaded to the 1.14 add-on server first,
so this repo is no longer necessary. See theirs instead here:
https://github.com/moonymeric/Saving_Elensefar/

Also apparently trewe's version is the original and is also available on GitHub here:
https://github.com/trewe/Saving_Elensefar

Description:
Meneldur, elvish mariner of Elensefar, is driven to sea by the same orcs who attacked the city.
He must gather an army willing to fight for him to regain Elensefar, his adopted homeland.
